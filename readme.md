## What is this?

This package exposes the names of popular packages on the public npm registry.
The definition of the term *popular* here is the same as what npm itself calls
*high-impact*.
They classify packages as having a high impact on the ecosystem when a package
meets one or more of the following conditions:

* download count of 1‚Äâ000‚Äâ000 or more per week
* depended on by 500 or more other packages

## When should I use this?

Please use this for fun experiments when researching the npm registry.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install npm-high-impact
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {npmHighImpact} from 'https://esm.sh/npm-high-impact@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {npmHighImpact} from 'https://esm.sh/npm-high-impact@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {npmHighImpact} from 'npm-high-impact'

console.log(npmHighImpact.length)
console.log(npmHighImpact)
```

```js

## API

This package exports the identifiers [`npmHighImpact`][api-npm-high-impact],
[`npmTopDependents`][api-npm-top-dependents], and
[`npmTopDownloads`][api-npm-top-downloads].
There is no default export.

### `npmHighImpact`

List of top package names (`Array<string>`).

Sorted by most downloaded first.
Includes (unique) packages from `npmTopDependents` and `npmTopDownloads`.

### `npmTopDependents`

List of package names that are depended on a lot (`Array<string>`).

Sorted by most dependents first.

### `npmTopDownloads`

List of package names that are downloaded a lot (`Array<string>`).

Sorted by most downloaded first.

## Data

> üëâ **Note**: not all of these packages are popular.
> There are some false-positives, such that download counts can be gamed, and
> that `libraries.io` sometimes thinks that a fork of webpack or so is actually
> webpack.

## Scripts

This repo includes several scripts to crawl different services.

###### All packages

`script/crawl-packages.js` follows an append-only database to find all the
changes to things in the npm registry.
We filter duplicates out, but still end up with ¬±2.5m ‚Äúthings‚Äù, which aren‚Äôt
all proper packages.
Later scripts will have to deal with them being missing.

The script takes like 12-18 hours to run (it finished somewhere at night).
But the good news is that it‚Äôs additive: so the next time you run it, it‚Äôll
only pull in everything that changed since you last ran in.

It crawls [`replicate.npmjs.com`][npm-replicate].

###### Top downloads

`script/crawl-top-download-unscoped.js` and
`script/crawl-top-download-scoped.js` look for download counts of all ¬±4.1m
packages on the registry.
Later scripts can filter the complete list to get the top packages.
The script takes like 30 hours to run.
About 10 hours is spent on ¬±3.2m unscoped packages.
Another 8 or so on ¬±900k scoped packages (yes, sad).
After filtering, the interesting data would result in about 6k packages.

It crawls the npm [package download count API][npm-api].
Unscoped packages are crawled using the batch API to get 128 per request.
Scoped packages are crawled with 20 HTTP requests at a time, as there is no
batch API, and higher rates are limited by npm.

###### Top dependents

`script/crawl-top-dependent.js` looks for packages that are depended on by
500 or more other packages.
The script takes like 30 minutes to run and currently gets about 3‚Äâ000
packages.

It crawls the `libraries.io` [project search API][libraries-io-api], whose
results can also [be browsed on the web][libraries-io-web].
Crawling stops paginating when a package is seen that is depended on by less
than 500 other packages.

You need an API key for `libraries.io`, see their API docs for more info.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

This package is at least compatible with all maintained versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 16+.
It also works in Deno and modern browsers.
